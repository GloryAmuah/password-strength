# password-strength

An algorithm to check the validity of a password inputted by a user with the criteria:\
● At least 1 letter between lowercase [ a - z ] -> 25%\
● At least 1 letter between uppercase [ A - Z ] -> 25%\
● At least 1 number between [ 0 - 9 ] -> 25%\
● At least 1 character from [ $@#&! ] -> 25%\

If these criteria are met, the user is returned a percentage value of how strong his/her
password is.
